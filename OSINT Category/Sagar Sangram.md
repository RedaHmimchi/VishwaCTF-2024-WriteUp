> Once upon a time there were 2 groups, one was known for being on positive side and other on negative side. Both the groups wanted to be immortal and hence required a divine potion for it. So they decided to "Churn the Ocean" to get the divine potion.

>It's a wonderful event written in some of the ancient scriptures. Hop on to the server and have a chat with bot, maybe he'll give you the flag.
