We had an attachment containing a zip file. Upon extracting the zip file, I executed the command "ls -a" and found a directory named ".git". To explore further, I used the command "git reflogs" to inspect the commit history.

While browsing through the commit history, I stumbled upon a text file containing flag characters and their corresponding indices. Additionally, within the commit history, there was a commit that has a Spotify web page and in its source code we have another flag characters. Furthermore, an image was also discovered in the commit history.

By combining these findings , I was able to get the flag.

string[9] = _
string[10] = 2
string[11] = 7
string[12] = 2
string[13] = 7

string[3: 6] = G1g

string[0] = G string[1] = 1 string[2] = t
